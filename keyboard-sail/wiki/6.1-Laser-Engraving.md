## Design your legends
1. Open the `laser_engraving_template.dwg` in DraftSight (from the zip you downloaded earlier).
2. The green squares represent the very top part of the keycap relative to the alignment tray, so you can place the fonts/legends in there.
3. Here are the specifications of your keycaps so make adjustments for larger keys. Red is the allignment tray, purple is the keycap edge, and green is the top surface. All units are in millimeters.

**When placing keycaps in the alignment tray, push the keycap all the way to the bottom left (because the squares are ~1mm too big).**
