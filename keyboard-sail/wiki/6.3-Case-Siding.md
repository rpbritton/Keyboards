## Goal: To close off the gaps between the top and bottom plate.
_We'll avoid the traditional sandwich case cutouts to save on acrylic._
1. Open DraftSight.
2. Create long strips that will make up an outline.
4. Add holes that cover each standoff.
5. Finally make 1 edge a quarter circle (so it aligns with the case).
6. Leave a gap for the USB connector.
