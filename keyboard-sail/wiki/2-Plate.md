# Creating the keyboard plates
We will be making plates from acrylic.
## CAD (Computer-Aided Design)
1. Log into one of the lab computers and open the program "Solid Edge".
2. Create a new "ANSI Draft".
3. Click the orb in the upper left, and go to Settings > Sheet setup. Change the size to "B Wide" and uncheck "Show background".
4. Save you file. Call it something similar to "YOURNAME - Plate".
5. You are now ready to start. Get a calculater and get your layout ready on [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) so you can calculate the key-size and key-spacing. (1u = 0.75").
6. Here are some general measurements:

Part | Dimensions
--- | ---
Switch Cutout | 0.551" x 0.551"
1u Switch Spacing | 0.75" x 0.75" (from center to center)
Recommended Outside Margin | 0.4"
Screw Hole Radius | 0.039"

Dimensions of a standard stabilizer (2u ≤ key-size ≤ 3u).

Dimensions of a spacebar stabilizer (6.25u)

8. Here is an example of numberpad's top plate. **The purple lines should not be there on the final draft, and are just shown to demonstrate the spacing.** Purple is key spacing, green is switch cutouts, blue is the outline, and yellow are the screw holes.

## Lasercutting your case
1. Email me your plate file so I can download them onto the computer connected to the laser cuter.
2. I'll just show you what to do.
