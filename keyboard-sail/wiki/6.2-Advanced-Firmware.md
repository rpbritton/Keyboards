## Some Repositories for Custom Firmware:
* [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)
* [TMK](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard) and [here's a guide](https://deskthority.net/workshop-f7/how-to-build-your-very-own-keyboard-firmware-t7177.html) about it.
* [EasyAVR](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=51252.0)
I don't know very much about this, so we can explore it together.
