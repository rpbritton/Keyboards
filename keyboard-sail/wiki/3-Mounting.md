As the acrylic used for the plates is not the correct thickness, the switches and stabilizers will not stick in place. We will use either super glue or hot glue to secure them. *The super glue is great as long as you don't mess up. The hot glue is much more forgiving.*
## Switches
1. It doesn't matter which direction a switch is placed, but I would recommend having the pins face the bottom.
2. Apply a small amount of glue to 2, 3, or 4 corners, and quickly place the switch in.
3. Hold it down until it does not move anymore.
## Stabilizers
1. File the hooks of the clips (as seen below) until they fit snuggly into the plate. The filing should be even, and the vertical parts should be parallel when inserted into the plate.

2. Orient the stabilizers so the larger side faces away from the switch.
3. Glue them down, making sure they are flush with the plate.
