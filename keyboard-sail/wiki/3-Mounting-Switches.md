As the acrylic used for the plates is not the correct thickness, the key switches will not stick in place. We will use either super glue or hot glue to secure them.    

1. It doesn't matter which direction a switch is placed, but I would recommend having the pins face the bottom.
2. Apply a small amount of glue to 2, 3, or 4 corners, and quickly place the switch in.
3. Hold it down until it does not move anymore.

*The super glue is great as long as you don't mess up. The hot glue is much more forgiving.*
