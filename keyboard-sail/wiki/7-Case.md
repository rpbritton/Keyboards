## Creating the bottom plate
1. Create a copy of your original plate file named "YOURNAME - Bottom Plate".
2. Open up your new file in Solid Edge.
3. Remove all the switch and stabilizer cutouts, leaving only screw holes and the outline.
4. Send that file to me via email to cut out.
## Creating walls for the case.
1. Make copy of the bottom plate case, call it something like "YOURNAME - Case Walls".
2. Create a rectangle inside the outline, whatever margin you used away from the edge. This way it will cut around where the wires and switches are.
3. Remove all screw holes not on the edges.
4. Enlarge all the remaining screw holes so that they are `0.12"` in diameter.
5. Create a break in the walls for the usb connector.
6. Send that to me and we'll cut out several, stacking them on top of each other to make up the walls of your case.
