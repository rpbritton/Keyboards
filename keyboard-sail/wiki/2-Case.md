# Creating the keyboard case
We will be making sandwich cases from acrylic.
## CAD (Computer-Aided Design): _More freedom, more prone to human error._
1. [Download DraftSight](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/draftsight-cad-software/free-download/) and open it.
2. This program is text-command based. When you type, it should show up at the bottom.
3. Try the command `new` and choose the default format. That should create a new file.
4. Run `save` and save two files, one for your bottom plate and one for your top plate.
5. You are now ready to start. Get a calculater. Get your layout ready on [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) so you know the key spacing. (1u = 19.05mm).
6. Start on the top plate, where the key cutouts will be. Use the `rect` command to create rectangles, and follow the prompts. Look at the specifications below to calculate the correct position and size.

   Part | Dimensions
   --- | ---
   Switch Cutout | 14.00x14.00mm
   Switch Spacing | 19.05x19.05mm
   Recommended Margin | 10.00mm
   Screw Hole Size | 1.95mm (diameter)
